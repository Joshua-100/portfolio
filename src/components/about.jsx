I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Zimbabwe, pursuing a Bachelor's Honours Degree in Computer Engineering. As I enter my third year, I'm preparing for industrial attachment, where I aim to gain hands-on experience in the tech industry and apply my skills in real-world environments.

With over two years of experience in frontend development, Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces using tools like React, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I'm always exploring new technologies, taking on creative projects, and striving to grow both technically and personally.
